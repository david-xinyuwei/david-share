## A2A Demo on Azure

This repository contains a minimal end-to-end demo that shows how multiple A2A-compatible micro-agents can cooperate behind a single LLM-based router while being protected by the same fixed Bearer-Token.
You will spin up four independent HTTP services:

• Calendar-Workday – manages weekday events
• Calendar-Weekend – manages weekend events
• Writer-Agent – generates short essays
• LLM Router – classifies each user request with an Azure-hosted model, then fan-outs secured JSON-RPC calls to the three downstream agents and aggregates their results.

Every direct call to an agent (except the router) is rejected unless the request header contains
`Authorization: Bearer <A2A_TOKEN>`.
The router automatically attaches this token when it invokes the other agents, so the user only needs to provide the token once when talking to the router.

```

① Client sends a single JSON-RPC request to the LLM Router (port 10009).
② Router uses an Azure LLM to classify the user intent(s).
③–④ Router fires parallel HTTP POSTs to the three downstream agents, each with the same Bearer token.
⑤ Agents complete their tasks and return JSON-RPC responses; Router aggregates them and returns a unified answer to the original client.

Any direct call to Calendar-Workday, Calendar-Weekend or Writer-Agent without the Bearer token responds with `401 Unauthorized`.

### Demo2

Legend

All solid arrows include the header `Authorization: Bearer $A2A_TOKEN`

① For the first loop iteration the script targets Calendar-Workday (`http://localhost:10007`), sending one **non-streaming** and one **streaming** A2A request, each with the Bearer token.
② In the second iteration it targets Calendar-Weekend (`http://localhost:10008`) and repeats the same pair of calls.

Each calendar agent validates the token, asks its internal LLM to create the event, and returns a JSON-RPC envelope.
The test script extracts the text from the envelope(s) and prints results to the console.

## What is A2A?

A2A, or Agent-to-Agent, is a protocol that enables AI agents with different capabilities and specialties to communicate directly, delegate tasks, and collaboratively complete work.

For example, it allows a master agent (like a personal assistant) to act like a project manager, coordinating the activities of multiple specialized agents.

This solves the current challenge where AI agents often operate in isolation, opening new possibilities for building complex, multi-agent collaborative systems.

According to official documentation, A2A is built on 5 core principles:

1. **Simplicity:** Leveraging existing standards (HTTP, JSON-RPC, SSE, push notifications, etc.).
2. **Enterprise-grade Support:** Native support for authentication, security, privacy, tracing, and monitoring.
3. **Async-first Approach:** Handles long-running tasks gracefully, providing meaningful progress updates.
4. **Multimodal Support:** Supports various data formats including text, audio/video, forms, iframes, etc.
5. **Opaque Execution:** No need for agents to expose internal thinking processes, detailed planning steps, or tools used to other agents.

You can think of it as a standardized way for AI agents to introduce themselves, describe their capabilities, and collaborate smoothly to accomplish tasks together.

![images](https://github.com/xinyuwei-david/david-share/blob/master/LLMs/A2A-Demo/images/1.png)

Next, let's examine the core components of A2A in detail.

## Key Components of the A2A Protocol

A2A consists of the following core components:

- **Client-Server Model:**
  A2A uses a client-server architecture, where a client agent requests tasks to be executed, while server agents or tools perform them. Roles can dynamically change during the task execution workflow.
- **Agent Cards:**
  JSON-formatted files acting like an agent's resume, comprising details such as Agent ID, name, capabilities, security details, and MCP support, enabling client agents to discover suitable specialized agents.
- **Task:**
  A task is the fundamental unit of A2A, clearly broken into various stages—submitted, working, input-required, completed, failed, or cancelled—allowing effective progress and workflow management.
- **Message Structure:**
  Within each task, agents communicate using messages. Messages carry actual content and support multimodal data formats.
- **Artefacts:**
  The final outputs of tasks are delivered as artefacts, which are structured results ensuring consistency and ease of use.

💡 **Note:** To keep things simple, we've only discussed the basics here. Deep dives can be found [here](https://composio.dev/blog/mcp-vs-a2a-everything-you-need-to-know/).

With this understanding of core components, let's delve into how the A2A protocol actually operates.

## How the A2A Protocol Works

![images](https://github.com/xinyuwei-david/david-share/blob/master/LLMs/A2A-Demo/images/2.png)

### Step 1: Agent Discovery

- Each specialized agent publishes an "Agent Card" (akin to the agent's resume).
- Agent Cards specify their capabilities (e.g., "travel planning," "budget analysis").
- Client agents use these Agent Cards to discover and select suitable specialized agents.

### Step 2: Task Delegation

- The requesting agent delegates the task to selected specialized agents.
- Delegated tasks are described in natural language, providing higher flexibility.
- For instance, "Find affordable flights and accommodations."
- Specialized agents intelligently interpret and execute these high-level requests.

### Step 3: Task Processing (Multiphase Interaction)

- Tasks have a lifecycle: Pending → Running → Intermediate Updates → Completed/Failed.
- Requesting agents receive acknowledgments, real-time progress updates, intermediate results, and continuous monitoring of task status.

### Step 4: Completion & Delivery

- After task completion, requesting agents gather all artefacts produced.
- The final outcome is cohesively presented (e.g., an integrated travel itinerary).
- Requesting agents may further refine collected data for presentation or future use.

Seamless agent collaboration enables complex workflows, but multi-agent systems often encounter difficulties like tool incompatibilities, lack of context, and varying goals.

To tackle these issues, MCP provides effective solutions.

## Agent Discovery Mechanism (Inspired by OpenID Connect)

How do agents discover and recognize each other?

Each hosting organization provides a public discovery URL for agents, structured as follows:

```
yourdomain.com/.well-known/agent.json
```



This JSON file acts as an agent's profile, typically including:

- Agent's Name and Description
- Claimed Capabilities
- Sample Queries handled
- Supported Modalities & Communication Protocols

This method is inspired by OpenID Connect's discovery mechanism (`.well-known/openid-configuration`). It ensures agents can dynamically discover and interact without tight coupling or manual configuration.

All agents use the `.well-known/agent.json` file for registration; thus, any new agent within the ecosystem can dynamically discover, evaluate, and interact using standardized communication provided by the A2A protocol.



## Comparison of A2A and MCP (Model Context Protocol)

| Feature             | MCP (Model Context Protocol)     | A2A (Agent-to-Agent Protocol)      |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Communication       | Agent ↔ External Systems or APIs | Agent ↔ Agent Communication        |
| Goal                | API integration                  | Collaboration and interoperability |
| Architectural Layer | Backend (Data/API access layer)  | Middle layer (Agent network layer) |
| Technical standards | REST, JSON, Database Drivers     | JSON-RPC, Services, Events         |
| Inspiration         | Language Server Protocol (LSP)   | OpenID Connect, Service Discovery  |

MCP equips agents with tools to perform independent tasks, whereas A2A facilitates cooperative interactions among multiple agents. Both protocols complement each other, ensuring efficient completion of single tasks and coordination of more complex, multi-step processes.

Anthropic's MCP and Google's A2A are both designed to support interactions between AI systems and their surrounding environments, but their scenarios and architectures differ:

| Category                | Anthropic MCP                                                | Google A2A                                                   |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Main Objective          | Connecting individual AI models with external tools and data pipelines | Supporting interactions across multiple autonomous AI agents |
| Best Fit Scenario       | Ideal for enterprise systems requiring secure and controlled data access | Suitable for distributed enterprise (B2B) environments needing agent collaboration |
| Communication Protocols | Local: STDIO; Remote: HTTP and SSE for real-time response    | HTTP/HTTPS-based; Webhooks and SSE; asynchronous, scalable messaging |
| Service Discovery       | Predefined, static server configurations; connections manually defined | Dynamic discovery via Agent Cards for capability-based connection |
| Interaction Pattern     | Top-down approach: LLM to external resource integration      | Peer-to-peer cooperative model among equal agents            |
| Security Approach       | Securing interactions between single AI model and external data/tools pipelines | Facilitating secure interactions between multiple agents across trust boundaries |
| Workflow Handling       | Optimized for straightforward request-response workflows     | Designed for complex tasks with workflow lifecycle and progress tracking |
